# Permission for Storage Access

Recently Mozilla announced it is joining Apple in implementing an API for servers to request access to storage, 
i.e. to HTTP cookies and other website data such as localStorage.
In the WebKit implementation access to storage is denied (to all resources sharing the main domain of the script origin) 
once the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) system detects tracking,
 while the Mozilla announcement suggests it will perhaps rely on a previously curated list of domains recognised as "trackers".

While introduced as part of the move towards active tracking protection in browsers, it also echoes legislative initiatives such
 as the EU's ePrivacy Directive, which since 2009 has required user consent for terminal storage
 (now referencing the GDPR's description of consent as "freely given, specific & informed", "unambiguous" 
and "via an affirmative act", where is "as easy to withdraw consent as to give it"), 
meaning any access to browser generated (e.g. cookies) or derived data (e.g. IP source addresses or fingerprinting).

A browsing context associated with an embedded `iframe`,
 calls a JavaScript function `requestStorageAccess`in the context of a user gesture. 
This returns a `Promise` which resolves immediately if storage access has already been allowed, 
or after the user has clicked the "Allow" button in a UA initiated pop-up.

This is similar to the generic functionality defined by the Permissions API, but is executable (only?) by nested
 browsing contexts (`iframes') rather than top-level pages. Users see the web in terms of the first-party
sites they navigate to, often unaware of third-party content or what the concept even means. and a prompt referring out of the blue to
an third-party domain name is likely to confuse them.

It would be useful to graft some of the ideas behind the Storage Access API into the Permissions API,
 by introducing a storage access `PermissionDescriptor` i.e. one with the name property set to 'storage-access'. 
This would be primarily called by top-level browsing contexts, 
but a could also be available to nested contexts if the top-level site enables that.
What is missing, for both the Permissions and Storage Access APIs,
is some way to explain to the user the reason why access to a feature is being requested, 
and to indicate the identity of the entity  requesting it. A user may not know what company a domain is managed by, 
for example they are unlikely to know that stats.g.doubleclick.net is managed by Google.

## Declarations via a /.well-known JSON manifest

One way to fix this is to require that the domain requesting access has to declare who they are, 
and the purposes for which the need access to storage. The DNT Tracking Protection Expression (TPE) document 
defined a JSON resource domain specific `/.well-known` location which could contain this information, the advantage being, 
as against say supplying the information in a parameter or dictionary property, that it would be harder for malware or less trusted code to amend it.

The UA could then pick up the required information from this resource and present it in its prompt pop-up.
The JSON resource would include a string for the entity's name, and a text body explaining how the storage would be used.
The UA could then re-present this information at any time the user requested it, say by clicking a "permissions" icon in the location bar. 
If the UA detected a change, say by recording a checksum, the granted feature (or storage) access could be automatically revoked.

## Defining the new features

A new (powerful) feature of 'storage-access' is proposed.

There is an associated parameter describing the type of access to be agreed, which could be one of


Value | Meaning
- | -
none | no access allowed, e.g. cookies would be purged if there and never sent
transient | storage will be limited by a pre-determined maximum duration or expiry time
partitioned | storage would be partitioned in the ITP sense.
full | access would be allowed as at present




## Specifying more restrictive defaults with Feature-Policy

Sites should be capable of specifying a more restrictive mode of storage access, 
to itself (possibly malware script operating in its context) and for its embedded third-parties.

If parametrisation is introduced in the Feature-Policy API:

`Feature-Policy: storage-access(partitioned); storage-access(full) 'self';

meaning all embedded resources (not just `iframes`) have only access to "partitioned" or "double-keyed" storage.

`Feature-Policy: storage-access 'self';`

meaning the top-level context has full access to storage, but the embeddees have none, 
unless the Permission query for possibly parametrised storage-access successfully resolves.

Third-party `iframes` could be give access to the storage-access permission API by:

`Feature-Policy: storage-access-permission: https://trustedpartner.com


## Site-specific consent


Users see the web in terms if the first-party sites they navigate to, 
often unaware of third-party content that may be collecting their online activity. 

Top-level sites should be capable of asking users for access to storage for itself
 and its embedded third-party resources, but only in the context of the top-level site, similar to the "Site-Specific"
consent defined in the DNT TPE. Users are likely to be more comfortable giving their consent, 
say to a publisher's top-level site and its embeddees if they can rely on it being restricted to that context.

This requires partitioned or "double-keyed" access to storage a la ITP, 
i.e. permission for `partitioned` storage-access.



## Consent indication header

If the UA is not enforcing the requirement for user consent, the servers have to take responsibility, 
so need to be made aware of that circumstance.

Browsing contexts making the API calls can find out their permission state, 
e.g. by FP introspection or Promise resolution, but other resources, 
unable to execute JavaScript, cannot. Even for document resources there would be a round-trip cost involved 
with determining the current state.
It would also be useful for servers handling non-document resources to be informed what access they have, 
for example the result of `Set-Cookie` response headers.

Perhaps an origin specific request header could indicate that, similar to idea behind the DNT:0 signal.

This could be
`Permission: storage-Access (partitioned)`, or perhaps
'Storage-Access: partitioned

`
